          scientific management of all fractions of waste, including safe
          disposal in scientific landfills. It is also aimed at remediation of
          all legacy dumpsites and converting them into green zones. As on date,

          The solid waste management sector in India has witnessed significant
          growth in recent years due to the government’s push towards
          cleanliness and sanitation. Increasing population and rapid
          urbanization have resulted in a substantial increase in the amount of
          waste generated, leading to the need for efficient and sustainable
          waste management practices. The government’s Swachh Bharat Abhiyan
          (Clean India Mission) has provided a boost to the sector, resulting in
          a surge in demand for waste management solutions. The market for solid
          waste management in India is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.5% during
          the forecast period (2021-2026), driven by factors such as increasing
          urbanization, rising awareness of waste management, and growing
          investments in waste management infrastructure.
